# Alternative Set of Jupyter Notebooks for TinyML Custom Keyword Spotting (KWS)

This repository is devoted to providing a fix for a set of jupyter notebooks used for Keyword Spotting (KWS).  The original notebook would no longer run due to the need to use Tensorflow 1.15 and the inability of Colab to permit the use of Python 3.6.c or 3.7.x.  

The notebooks are used as part of Section 1.5, "Deploying a KWS Model with Your Favorite Keyword(s)" of Course 3, Deploying TinyML.  This course is part of the <a href="https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-applied-tiny-machine-learning-tinyml-for-scale">Applied Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) for Scale Professional Certificate Program</a> offered through <a href="[url](https://www.edx.org)">edx.org</a>.
